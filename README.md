This project is a Chess game implemented in Python using the CustomTkinter library for the graphical user interface. 
The game allows two players to play against each other on the same machine on a standard 8x8 chessboard with all the standard chess rules.
You can also customize the appearance of the board and the pieces.
All the game events are displayed in a text box next to the chessboard.
